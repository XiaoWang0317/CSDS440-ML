The well known Pythagorean theorem \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\) was 
proved to be invalid for other exponents. 
Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions:

$L_{VAE}^{trd}=E\[log_{p_\theta}(x_L|z_L)\]-\beta D_{KL}(q_\chi(z_L|x_L)||p_z)+E\[log_{p_\theta}(x_U|z_U)\]-\beta D_{KL}(q_\chi(z_U|x_U)||p_z)$
